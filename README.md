# Fit & Meets- A gamified dating app that combines wearable devices and location based service
We found that many single friends around me are interested in dating-app. 
However, we discovered there are two main problems in dating-apps on the current market. 

1. Although dating-apps can search for nearby friends, it is still limited to virtual instead of real-world.
2. Users are easy to leave the service when they have gotten the contact information.

Thus, we decided to develop a campus dating app for our graduation project, using the following features:

- Combining exercise and matching feature.
- The task and game system motivate people to go outside.
- Using wearable device to decect heart rate and combining it in the game.


We tried to solve the shortcomings of the existing dating-app, and motivated students to go outside and know each other.

## Where are we different from other dating-apps ? 

- You can match people in real-world through our gamified-oriented system, just like Pokemon Go.
- Not only know new friends who are now nearby, but also find each other's "common place".
- Privacy Protection: display each other's location only if you both agree with it.

## Location Based Service

### What is Location Based Service ?

Location-based services combine geospatial technologies, information and communication technologies, and the Internet to provide targeted information to individuals based on their geographic location in real-time.

Famous Application: Pokemon Go, Ingress

## Heart Rate Detection with Fitbit Watch:

We apply the heart rate detection into the chat room. If people’s heart rate are greater than 10 bpm of the average, cherry blossom rain will be sprinkled over the chat room to enhance a romantic atmosphere.
